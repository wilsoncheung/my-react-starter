# 1st Attempt: React Starter App

My first attempt in creating a generic React web app ready with **React Router**, **Bootstrap 4** and **Font Awesome**!! :laughing::laughing:

This project can be use to kick start future React app projects :smiley:.


### Getting Started


First go to terminal and change directory to where you want to copy remote repo into.
Then do the following:

##### Clone Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/wilsoncheung/my-react-starter.git
```


##### Install Necessary packages

```
npm install
```


##### Start Development Project

```
npm start
```


You are set and can start modifying the project however much you want!

## Happy Coding!! :satisfied::satisfied:
