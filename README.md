# React Starter 

My first attempt in creating a generic React web app ready with **Hash Router**, **Bootstrap 4** and **Font Awesome**!! :laughing::laughing:<br>
I created this so that I can easily kick start any future React base projects (ex: Portfolio, Educational, Nonprofit, etc...) :smiley:.



### Getting Started


First go to your terminal and change directory to where you want to copy the remote repo into.<br>
Then do the following:


##### Clone Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/wilsoncheung/my-react-starter.git
```


##### Install Necessary packages

```
npm install
```


##### Start Development Project

```
npm start
```


You are set and can start modifying the project however you want!

## Happy Coding!! :satisfied::satisfied:
